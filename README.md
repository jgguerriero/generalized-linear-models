# generalized-linear-models
This is a working R script that provides a low-level walk-through (i.e., using linear algebra and optimization methods) for obtaining some of the parameters and statistics associated with the generalized linear model.

Includes:
  - Linear regression
    - OLS coefficients for multiple linear regression
    - Standard errors associated with OLS coefficients
    - Translating linear regression to 3x2 ANOVA sums of squares (Type 3)
    - Weighted least squares coefficients for multiple linear regression
    - Standard errors associated with WLS coefficients
  - Logistic regression
    - Numeric solution for logistic regression coefficients

# generalized-linear-models
This is a working R script that provides a low-level walk-through (i.e., using linear algebra and optimization methods) for obtaining some of the statistics associated with the generalized linear model.

Includes:
  - OLS coefficients for multiple linear regression
  - Standard errors associated with OLS coefficients
  - Translating linear regression to 3x2 ANOVA sums of squares (Type 3)
  - Weighted least squares solution for multiple linear regression
  - Standard errors associated with WLS coefficients
  - Numeric solution for coefficients from logistic regression
